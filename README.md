## About The Project
This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Database Systems course at Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering. The goal of the project was to create a database system for a school, which would be used by the school's administration and the students. The system is divided into two parts: a website and a desktop application. The desktop application is used by the school's administration to manage the database, while the website is used by the students and teachers.

The database is designed using the Entity-Relationship model, and the system is implemented using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, C# .NET Framework, and MS SQL Server. The website is hosted on a local server, while the desktop application is a standalone application. The system is designed to be secure, and it uses the latest web technologies to provide a smooth user experience.

The relations included in the database are:
- Student
- Graduated Students
- Teacher
- Department
- Staff
- Room
- Bus
- Subject
- Parent
- Enrollment
- Subject Time-Locations
- Announcement
- Posts
